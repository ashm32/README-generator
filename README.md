# Professional README Generator

The project is a README generator that helps users create README files without worrying about applying proper Markdown syntax. It addresses the problem of overlooked READMEs in projects, often due to laziness, lack of knowledge of Markdown syntax, or uncertainty about what to include. By prompting the user with specific questions, the README generator allows them to generate a professional and comprehensive README based on their responses. This process only takes a few minutes and empowers developers to make their projects completer and more professional. Having a well-crafted README increases the likelihood that others will choose their application over similar ones without a README.

## Installation

To get started with the application, follow these steps: 1. Click on the repository link (https://github.com/ashm32/README-generator). 2. Download the zip file and extract its contents. 3. Open the extracted folder in your preferred code editor, such as VS Code. 4. In the code editor, open the integrated terminal. 5. Make sure the terminal's current directory is set to the root directory of the project (named 'readmeGen'). You are now ready to run the application!

## Usage

After installing the required dependencies, execute the command node index.js in the terminal. Respond to the prompts as instructed. Once the process is finished, you will see a message confirming the creation of the file, and you can locate the generated file named README.md in the root folder. The generated file will be in Markdown syntax, allowing you to conveniently copy and paste the code into your project.
